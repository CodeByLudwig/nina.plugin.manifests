        "LongDescription": "This Plugin provides an instruction and triggers for the Advanced to run an AF with your camera lens attached to a Canon Camera\r\n\r\n## Important Note!\r\n**Test the plugin before you use it in your imaging runs, because this plugin may not work for everyone! This plugin doesn't work with ASCOM.DSLR unfortuantely!**  \r\nIf you have questions/feedback/issues, you can ask on the [NINA discord](https://discord.com/invite/nighttime-imaging) in #plugin-discussions, take a look in the [wiki](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/wiki) or create an issue [here](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/issues)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Requirements**: \r\n- A Canon Camera,  \r\n- A Camera Lens that supports AF\r\n- The plugin only runs in the advanced sequencer and the imaging tab\r\n\r\nThe plugin was tested using the following camera and lenses (Note that there are often issues with third-party lenses, so be aware of that):\r\n- Canon EOS 600d\r\n- Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM\r\n- Canon EF 24-105 f/4 L IS USM\r\n\r\n## Manual Focus Control controls\r\n- Mousewheel/Trackpad: Zoom in/out\r\n- Left mousebutton: Pan around\r\n- Right mousebutton: reset\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- Some cameras or lenses may try to refocus, when taking images if the lens is set to AF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Troubleshooting:\r\nWhat to try if:\r\n- ...the focus doesn't move: Try a different step size (2 always worked for me) or try switching your lens from AF/MF to MF/AF\r\n- ...the plugin didn't result in good focus: Try a different step size (2 always worked for me)",
