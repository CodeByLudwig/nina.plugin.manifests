This plugin doesn\u0027t work with ASCOM.DSLR unfortuantely!**  \r\nIf you have questions/feedback/issues, you can ask on the [NINA discord](https://discord.com/invite/nighttime-imaging) in #plugin-discussions, take a look in the [wiki](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/wiki) or create an issue [here](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/issues)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Requirements**: \r\n- A Canon Camera,  \r\n- A Camera Lens that supports AF\r\n- The plugin only runs in the advanced sequencer and the imaging tab\r\n\r\nThe plugin was tested using the following camera and lenses:\r\n- Canon EOS 600d\r\n- Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM\r\n- Canon EF 24-105 f/4 L IS USM\r\n\r\n## Manual Focus Control controls\r\n- Mousewheel/Trackpad: Zoom in/out\r\n- Left mousebutton: Pan around\r\n- Right mousebutton: reset\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- Some cameras or lenses may try to refocus, when taking images if the lens is set to AF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Troubleshooting:\r\nWhat to try if:\r\n- ...the focus doesn\u0027t move: Try a different step size (2 always worked for me) or try switching your lens from AF/MF to MF/AF\r\n- ...the plugin didn\u0027t result in good focus: Try a different step size (2 always worked for me)"
