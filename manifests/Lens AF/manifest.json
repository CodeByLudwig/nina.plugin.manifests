This plugin doesn\u0027t work with ASCOM.DSLR unfortuantely!**\r\nIf you have questions/feedback/issues, you can ask on the [NINA discord](https://discord.com/invite/nighttime-imaging) in #plugin-discussions or create an issue [here](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/issues)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Requirements**: \r\n- A Canon Camera,  \r\n- A Camera Lens that supports AF\r\n- The Camera has to be connected to NINA before the sequence gets loaded in to be correctly picked by the plugin\r\n\r\nThe plugin was tested using the following camera and lenses:\r\n- Canon EOS 600d\r\n- Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM\r\n- Canon EF 24-105 f/4 L IS USM\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- Some cameras or lenses may try to refocus, when taking images if the lens is set to AF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Troubleshooting:\r\nWhat to try if:\r\n- ...the focus doesn\u0027t move: Try a different step size (6 always worked for me) or try switching your lens from AF/MF to MF/AF\r\n- ...the plugin didn\u0027t result in good focus: Try a different step size (6 always worked for me)\r\n- ...the sequence item doesn\u0027t detect the camera: Try to delete and add the sequence item again"
