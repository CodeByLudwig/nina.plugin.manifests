        "LongDescription": "This plugin improves Star Annotation and Auto Focus for NINA. Improved star detection and additional Auto Focus features are on the way as well\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n\r\n*AutoFocus*\r\n\r\n* Substantially faster by analyzing exposures while next focus points are being exposed\r\n\r\n*Customizable Star Annotation*\r\n* Customizable colors and fonts for star annotations\r\n* Dynamic reloading of star annotations without needing to re-run star detection\r\n\r\nTo enable these features, go to Options -\u003e Imaging -\u003e Image Options. After this plugin is installed, there will be Star Annotator and Auto Focus dropdown boxes you can select \"Hocus Focus\" for.\r\n\r\n**Features coming soon**\r\n\r\n*Improved star detection*\r\n\r\n* Faster for large sensors, particularly APS-C and Full Frame\r\n* Higher accuracy (lower HFR Standard Deviation) if parameters are set properly\r\n* Advanced control over star detection parameters\r\n* Can use the new Star Detector or Annotator without requiring both. Keep what you like\r\n* Eccentricity calculation\r\n\r\n*AutoFocus*\r\n\r\n* Fast focus mode when still close to a recent auto focus that can utilize fewer steps, smaller step sizes, and a different fitting as the regular \"blind\" focus\r\n* Incorporation of measurement error into quality measurement of focusing results\r\n* Focusing individual color channels instead of just luminance for OSC, since that is skewed towards green focus\r\n",
