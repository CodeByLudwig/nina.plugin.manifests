        "LongDescription": "This plugin is intended to provide some basic tools to improve multi target planning by scrying future targets and predicting their state to react on these.  \r\n\r\nFor example - you know that a target is obstructed until it reaches a certain altitude, so you want to loop another target for as long as that target is below that specific altitude.",
